Hi, my name's Daniel. 

I'm a core contributor to <a href="https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane" target="_blank">Fastlane</a> and a big fan of all things Apple. 

I enjoy running, watching anime and picking up new skills. I'm a lifelong learner at heart.

I've built exactly one LEGO set in my life. And I loved every second of it!

Lately, I've been getting into mechanical watches.
